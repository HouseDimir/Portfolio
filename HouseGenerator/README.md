# HouseGenerator

A program designed to generate a randomized floor plan for a house
based on the number of rooms desired per floor and the number of 
floors desired in total. Currently the only active module is gen.py,
though it is planned for this to then draw out the design of each 
floor through bp.py (likely using the tkinter library) and eventually
work as a practice tool for pip packaging.
